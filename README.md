This repository contains CAD files, .stl files, user manual with assembly instructions, the firmware and the Bill Of Materials.

MOTUS is a 6 DoF Open-Source robot arm that is almost completely 3D printed. It is controllable through software or using a remote control. In its extended position, MOTUS has a 600 mm reach and can lift loads up to 500 grams.

The robot's structure is fully printed using additive manufacturing technologies and its electronics are controlled with Arduino IDE. Furthermore, standarized components are defined on the bill of materials to enable and simplify the sourcing of components as well as overall assembly of the arm.

MOTUS has been developed by three Elisava fourth year students of the Industrial Design Engineering degree. The goal is to give access to the acedemic and educational aspects that robotics can accomodate. Having a robot that is cheap, repairable and customizable fosters a creative university or school ecosystem in which users can acces and learn by doing.

MOTUS brings digital manufactuing technology and Industry 4.0 to everyone.
